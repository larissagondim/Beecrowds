# My Beecrowd (URI) Problem Solving Journey

Welcome to my Beecrowd (formerly URI Online Judge) solutions repository! This project serves as a personal log of my progress and solutions for various competitive programming problems from the platform. The main goal is to document my learning process, practice different algorithms, and improve my problem-solving skills.

## 🎯 About This Repository

This repository contains my accepted solutions to problems on [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br/). Each solution is organized by its problem ID, making it easy to navigate and find specific problems. I started this as a way to keep track of my progress and to have a collection of my work that I can review and improve upon over time.

Feel free to browse the solutions, but I highly encourage you to try solving the problems on your own first!

## 📂 Repository Structure

The solutions are organized into directories named after the problem ID. Each directory contains the source code file for that problem.

```
.
├── 1001 - Extremely Basic/
│   └── main.c
├── 1002 - Area of a Circle/
│   └── main.cpp
├── 1253 - Caesar Cipher/
│   └── main.c
└── ...

## 💻 Languages Used

I am primarily using the following languages for my solutions. The language used for a specific solution will be indicated by the file extension.

* **C**
* **C++**
* **Python**
